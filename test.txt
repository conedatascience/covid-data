**Outbreaks that are considered over. Beginning on June 9, 2020, the previous outbreaks section will only include outbreaks that were closed since the last report
was published. An outbreak is considered over if there is not evidence of continued transmission within the facility. This is measured as 28 days after the latest
date of onset in a symptomatic person or the first date of specimen collection from the most recent asymptomatic person, whichever is later.
Correctional facilities listed on previous reports may be removed when they are included within the correctional facilities operated by state or federal government.
